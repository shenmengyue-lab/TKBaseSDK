If you want to using KVO and update the UI, make sure to dispatch on the main queue. And it's recommand to use some KVO libs like KVOController because it's more safe and easy to use.

 * @param placeholder    The image to be set initially, until the image request finishes.
 * @param options        The options to use when downloading the image. @see TKSDWebImageOptions for the possible values.
 * @param context        A context contains different options to perform specify changes or processes, see `TKSDWebImageContextOption`. This hold the extra objects which `options` enum can not hold.
 * @param setImageBlock  Block used for custom set image code. If not provide, use the built-in set image code (supports `UIImageView/NSImageView` and `UIButton/NSButton` currently)
 * @param progressBlock  A block called while image is downloading
 *                       @note the progress block is executed on a background queue
 * @param completedBlock A block called when operation has been completed.
 *   This block has no return value and takes the requested UIImage as first parameter and the NSData representation as second parameter.
 *   In case of error the image parameter is nil and the third parameter may contain an NSError.
 *
 *   The forth parameter is an `TKSDImageCacheType` enum indicating if the image was retrieved from the local cache
 *   or from the memory cache or from the network.
 *
 *   The fith parameter normally is always YES. However, if you provide TKSDWebImageAvoidAutoSetImage with TKSDWebImageProgressiveLoad options to enable progressive downloading and set the image yourself. This block is thus called repeatedly with a partial image. When image is fully downloaded, the
 *   block is called a last time with the full image and the last parameter set to YES.
 *
 *   The last parameter is the original image URL
